        <h3>HeartView: An extensible, open-source, web-based signal quality
          assessment pipeline for ambulatory
          cardiovascular data</h3>
        <p>Wearable sensing systems enable peripheral physiological
          data to be collected repeatedly in naturalistic
          settings. However, the ambulatory nature of wearable
          biosensors predisposes them to common signal artifacts
          that researchers must address before analysis. Signal
          quality assessment procedures are time-consuming and
          non-standardized across research teams, and transparent
          reporting of custom, closed-source pipelines needs
          improvement. This paper presents HeartView, an
          extensible, open-source, web-based signal quality
          assessment pipeline that visualizes and quantifies
          missing beats and invalid segments in heart rate
          variability (HRV) data obtained from ambulatory
          electrocardiograph (ECG) and photoplethysmograph (PPG)
          signals. We demonstrate the utility of our pipeline on
          two datasets: (1) 34 ECGs recorded with the Actiwave
          Cardio from children with and without autism, and (2)
          15 sets of ECGs and PPGs recorded with the RespiBAN and
          Empatica E4, respectively, from healthy adults in the
          publicly available WESAD dataset. Our pipeline
          demonstrates interpretable group differences in
          physiological signal quality. ECGs of children with
          autism contain more missing beats and invalid segments
          than those without autism. Similarly, PPG data contains
          more missing beats and invalid segments than ECG data.
          HeartView has a graphical user interface in the form of
          a web-based dashboard at

        <h3>From beat to better: Exploring music-based entrainment for
          health</h3>
        <p>Music has the increasingly recognized potential to
          promote physical and mental health, as evidenced by
          prior work on music engagement and its benefits on
          improved physical, cognitive, immune, and
          socioemotional functioning. However, the mechanisms
          underlying such effects still need to be better
          understood. One process that researchers have
          frequently quantified to understand these effects is
          music-based entrainment. This mapping review aims to
          (1) summarize evidence for the effects of music
          engagement in various health domains through
          intrapersonal and interpersonal entrainment and (2)
          identify open questions for future work. This review
          serves as a resource to inform the research priorities
          of health and music psychology experts who may be
          interested in evaluating and designing music-based
          psychosocial paradigms and health interventions.</p>

        <h3>Contemporary biosensing technologies and systems for music-based
          stress management</h3>
        <p>In the last decade, researchers have explored
          leveraging biosensing technology to deliver music-based
          stress management interventions across laboratory and
          naturalistic contexts. From interactive music
          applications and affective music players to
          biofeedback devices and brain-computer interfaces, these
          technologies and systems are designed to offer users
          engaging and personalized experiences that enhance
          stress-related therapeutic outcomes. Drawing upon a
          range of systematic reviews and empirical research
          published in the last decade, this mapping review
          categorizes the current landscape of systems
          integrating biosensing technology and music for stress
          management. By mapping the current landscape, this
          review offers insights into emerging trends and
          existing gaps and guides research and development at
          the intersection of music, affective computing, and
          therapy.</p>
