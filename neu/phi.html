                        assessment pipeline for ambulatory cardiovascular
                        data</span>
                    <p>Wearable sensing systems enable peripheral physiological
                        data to be collected repeatedly in naturalistic
                        settings. However, the ambulatory nature of wearable
                        biosensors predisposes them to common signal artifacts
                        that researchers must address before analysis. Signal
                        quality assessment procedures are time-consuming and
                        non-standardized across research teams, and transparent
                        reporting of custom, closed-source pipelines needs
                        improvement. This paper presents HeartView, an
                        extensible, open-source, web-based signal quality
                        assessment pipeline that visualizes and quantifies
                        missing beats and invalid segments in heart rate
                        variability (HRV) data obtained from ambulatory
                        electrocardiograph (ECG) and photoplethysmograph (PPG)
                        signals. We demonstrate the utility of our pipeline on
                        two datasets: (1) 34 ECGs recorded with the Actiwave
                        Cardio from children with and without autism, and (2)
                        15 sets of ECGs and PPGs recorded with the RespiBAN and
                        Empatica E4, respectively, from healthy adults in the
                        publicly available WESAD dataset. Our pipeline
                        demonstrates interpretable group differences in
                        physiological signal quality. ECGs of children with
                        autism contain more missing beats and invalid segments
                        than those without autism. Similarly, PPG data contains
                        more missing beats and invalid segments than ECG data.

                        beat to better: Exploring music-based entrainment
                        for health</span>
                    <p>Music has the increasingly recognized potential to
                        promote physical and mental health, as evidenced by
                        prior work on music engagement and its benefits on
                        improved physical, cognitive, immune, and
                        socioemotional functioning. However, the mechanisms
                        underlying such effects still need to be better
                        understood. One process that researchers have
                        frequently quantified to understand these effects is
                        music-based entrainment. This mapping review aims to
                        (1) summarize evidence for the effects of music
                        engagement in various health domains through
                        intrapersonal and interpersonal entrainment and (2)
                        identify open questions for future work. This review
                        serves as a resource to inform the research priorities
                        of health and music psychology experts who may be
                        interested in evaluating and designing music-based
                        psychosocial paradigms and health interventions.</p>

                    <p>In the last decade, researchers have explored
                        leveraging biosensing technology to deliver music-based
                        stress management interventions across laboratory and
                        naturalistic contexts. From interactive music
                        applications and affective music players to
                        biofeedback devices and brain-computer interfaces, these
                        technologies and systems are designed to offer users
                        engaging and personalized experiences that enhance
                        stress-related therapeutic outcomes. Drawing upon a
                        range of systematic reviews and empirical research
                        published in the last decade, this mapping review
                        categorizes the current landscape of systems
