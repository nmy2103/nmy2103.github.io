        <p>Dyadic synchrony, the temporal coordination of behavioral and
          physiological processes in two or more interacting partners, is a
          phenomenon associated with various relational processes, including
          social bonding, empathy, prosociality, emotional co-regulation,
          and teamwork. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a
          neurodevelopmental condition characterized by socio-communicative
          challenges, there is a nascent, growing body of research that
          highlights the relevance of dyadic synchrony to uncovering
          biobehavioral mechanisms associated with social difficulties.
          Multimodal approaches with different time series techniques to
          measure dyadic synchrony in individuals with autism, however,
          remain inadequately explored.</p>
        <p>In this dissertation proposal, I present a multimodal and
          multimethod assessment of physiological and behavioral synchrony
          in parents and young children with and without ASD. Specifically,
          I will investigate three types of dyadic synchrony—trend synchrony
          (TS), concurrent synchrony (CS), and lagged synchrony (LS)—in
          heart rate and social-communication measures using the following
          time series techniques: 1) cross-correlation, 2) centered
          pointwise distance, 3) dynamic time warping, 4) cross-wavelet
          analysis, and 5) cross-recurrence quantification analysis. I will
          use standardized parent-report measures of child social
          responsiveness, moment-to-moment dyadic proximity, joint
          engagement (JE), and vocal turn-taking, as well as parent and
          child heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), to address
          the following aims. First, I will perform a validation study by 1)
          comparing and evaluating the consistency of each TS, CS, and LS
          measure with other corresponding measures (e.g., TS measure
          compared to other TS measures), and 2) assessing TS, CS, and LS
          measures against child social responsiveness and dyadic JE states
          as ground truth. Following the validation, I will examine
          within-group associations to explore how dyadic behavioral
          synchrony (i.e., in vocal turn-taking) relate to those of dyadic
          physiological synchrony (i.e., in HR and HRV). Next, I will
          investigate between-group differences in measures of vocal
          turn-taking synchrony and HR and HRV synchrony between dyads with
          and without ASD. Finally, I will develop mixed-effects predictive
          models to assess whether dyadic synchrony of HR, HRV, and vocal
          turn-taking can reliably predict joint engagement states.
          Together, findings from my analyses will contribute to greater
          understanding of the interplay between behavioral and
          physiological dynamics in autism. With a multimodal and
          multimethod approach, this dissertation will provide insight into
          diverse time series techniques to assess dyadic biobehavioral
          synchrony in autism, informing future work on biomarker
          identification and intervention development.</p>
