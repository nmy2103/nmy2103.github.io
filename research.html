            <p>I currently perform signal quality assessment for
                collaborators who are exploring physiological correlates of
                intervention effects observed in children and adolescents
                with autism. In the Computational Behavioral Science Lab, I
                lead the following projects.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: -5px">HeartView: An extensible,
                open-source, and web-based signal quality assessment
                pipeline for ambulatory cardiovascular data</h3>

            <p>Wearable sensor systems allow electrocardiograph (ECG) data to
                be collected less obtrusively, especially from populations
                who may present with behavioral or attentional difficulties.
                However, given the ambulatory and high sampling frequencies
                of these systems, raw ECG data is often noisy and requires
                pre-processing that is typically time-consuming and
                non-standardized due to non-transparent reporting of
                closed-source pipelines. In this project, I am developing an
                <a href="https://heartview.readthedocs.io/en/latest"
                   target="new">open-source pipeline with an accompanying
                    web-based dashboard</a> that can perform signal quality
                assessment on ambulatory physiological data from ECG,
                photoplethysmograph (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA)
                devices.

            <h3>A multimodal and multimethod assessment of dyadic
                biobehavioral synchrony in children with autism spectrum
                disorder</h3>

            <p>Dyadic synchrony is the temporal coordination of behavioral
                and physiological processes between two individuals. This
                coordination has important consequences for social
                and relational processes, which appear atypical in
                individuals with autism. Moreover, research on autism has
                seen a growing trend towards finding potential genetic,
                neurological, and physiological markers, with the rationale
                that biomarkers could better identify clinical subgroups and
                guide more personalized treatment planning. <br>
                I am interested in exploring how sociobehavioral and cardiac
                signals interact synchronously (or asynchronously) during
                dyadic interactions between children with autism and their
                caregivers. <br>
