            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>I am currently performing signal quality assessment for collaborators who are exploring physiological correlates of intervention effects observed in children and adolescents with autism. In the Computational Behavioral Science Lab, I lead the following projects.</p>

            <p>Wearable sensor systems allow electrocardiogram (ECG) data to
                be collected less obtrusively, especially from populations
                who may present with behavioral or attentional difficulties.
                However, given the ambulatory and high sampling frequencies
                of these systems, raw ECG data is often noisy and requires
                pre-processing that is typically time-consuming and
                non-standardized due to non-transparent reporting of
                closed-source pipelines. In this project, I am developing an
                open-source pipeline with an accompanying web-based dashboard
                that can perform signal quality assessment on ambulatory
                physiological data from ECG, photoplethysmograph
                (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) devices.</p>
        
            <h3>Interpersonal biobehavioral synchrony between children with autism and their caregivers</h3>
            <img class="research-img-left" src="assets/mother_son_book.png" style="width: 200px; margin-top: 10px">
            <p>Interpersonal synchrony is the temporal coordination of
                behaviors, emotions, and physiological processes between two or
                more individuals. This coordination has important consequences
                for social communication, which is impaired in autism according
                to the DSM-5. Moreover, research on autism has seen a growing
                trend towards finding potential genetic, neurological, and
                physiological markers, with the rationale that biomarkers could
                better identify clinical subgroups and thus confirm diagnosis
                and guide more personalized treatment planning. I am interested
                in exploring how social behaviors and cardiovascular and/or
                electrodermal activity interact synchronously (or
                asynchronously) during dyadic interactions between children
                with autism and their caregivers.</p>
